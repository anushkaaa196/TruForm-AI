"""Fatigue & Form Degradation Detection Engine for TRUFORM AI.

Performs explainable, heuristic estimation of movement form degradation over time.
Analyzes multi-repetition score trajectories, rising instability, range-of-motion decay,
and correction frequency to identify workout fatigue.

NOTE: This provides educational biomechanical guidance and does NOT provide medical
or clinical fatigue diagnosis.
