# 🏋️ TruForm AI

## AI-Powered Real-Time Exercise Form & Biomechanics Analysis Platform

**TruForm AI** is an AI-powered real-time exercise form analysis system designed to help users perform exercises with correct posture and movement techniques.

The system uses **Computer Vision, Human Pose Estimation, and Artificial Intelligence** to analyze body movements in real time and identify potential posture and form-related issues during exercise.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Incorrect exercise posture and movement can lead to:

* ❌ Muscle strain and injuries
* ❌ Joint and spine-related problems
* ❌ Reduced exercise effectiveness
* ❌ Long-term physical damage

Professional trainers can continuously monitor exercise form, but such guidance may not always be accessible or affordable.

**TruForm AI addresses this challenge by providing an intelligent and accessible system for automated exercise form analysis.**

---

## 💡 Solution

TruForm AI uses an AI-driven approach to analyze human body movements through a camera.

The system:

1. 📷 Captures the user's exercise movement.
2. 🧍 Detects human body posture and keypoints.
3. 🧠 Analyzes body movement and biomechanics.
4. 📐 Evaluates exercise form and posture.
5. ⚠️ Identifies incorrect movement patterns.
6. 💬 Provides real-time feedback to help improve exercise performance.
